# INFO-201-Final-Project
The final project in Informatics 201-Technical Foundations. In this project, we created a shiny app that uses data from Donald Trump's tweets and his approval ratings.

Trump's Tweets and His Approval Rating During 2017
created by Roshni Sinha, Michelle Ponting, Andy Straavaldson and John Reese -- Group AA2

Donald Trump often takes to Twitter to share his thoughts with the American public. As president of the United States, his duties and the perception of the American public are often intertwined. Twitter, a social media platform used to share short posts, acts as a means of communication between Trump and both his supporters and rivals, allowing others an insight to his mind and life in the Oval Office. In this assignment, we analyzed the effect Trump's tweets had on his approval rating in 2017. By comparing these two sets of data, we can gain broader knowledge of how social media is used in politics.

We created a shiny page that allows users to change different inputs in order to answer our questions that we had about the data. The page is pretty simple to use and can be found at the following [link](https://johnreese212.shinyapps.io/INFO-201-Final-Project/).
